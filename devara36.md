i. The content is interesting as it covers different aspects of computing in society. The sports page covers a lot about the use of computing
   in sports, it is also backed up with relevant websites which is good.
   
   GOOD
   
ii. The visual quality of the html pages are good, but the pages can use some colour. The main page is excellent (though the
    author description is slightly unclear); however, the other two pages lack consistency in terms of colour and layout. The layout in the
    sports page could use fixing.
    
    GOOD
    
iii. The quality of written presentation is very good, it covers the aspects of computing in society in detail, and it is easy to read.
     The self-driving cars page could use a little more detail (it should be as detailed as the sports page).
     
     VERY GOOD  

iv. The HTML validity is excellent; however, I believe it is good practice to always include the closing brackets (</ul>, HubPage.html)

  Excellent

v. All the author info was written by different people, each member contributed to the webpages and it looks like the task is not completed
   at the last minute.
   
  Excellent
